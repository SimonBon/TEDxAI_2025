# Forschungsfest-2025

![Capture-2025-03-18-133202](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/722aee17-21c0-45a5-8f01-8283f4b0b69e)

This repository is part of the **St. Anna Children's Cancer Research Institute's** contribution to the [Vienna Forschungsfest 2025](https://wirtschaftsagentur.at/termine-events-workshops/wiener-forschungsfest-2025/).  

It features an **interactive game** that simulates the process of detecting **genetic aberrations in microscopic images**, a critical task in medical diagnostics. The game highlights the challenges of **manual image evaluation**, emphasizing that human analysis is **time-consuming and error-prone**. It also demonstrates how **AI can significantly improve this process**, offering **faster and more reliable** results in many scenarios.  

‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** The GUI has only been tested on **Linux and macOS**. Windows users may experience compatibility issues.

## üõ† Installation  

1. **Create a source directory in your home folder:**
   ```bash
   cd ~
   mkdir src
   cd src
   ```

2. **Clone the required repositories:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SimonBon/Forschungsfest-2025
   git clone https://github.com/SimonBon/DiagnosticFISH_package
   ```

3. **Navigate to the `Forschungsfest-2025` folder, create a Conda environment, and activate it:**
   If you do not have conda installed, please refer to the anaconda webpage to install it.
   
   ```bash
   cd Forschungsfest-2025
   conda env create -f environment.yml
   conda activate FF
   ```

5. **Download the necessary files to run the model and display microscopic images:**
   ```bash
   python GUI/zenodo_utils.py -o .
   ```

6. **Start the application:**
   ```bash
   python GUI/app.py
   ```

üéâ **You're all set! Enjoy the game!**

## üî¨ Background  

The game displays **synthetic microscopic images** where individual cells are placed on a black background, ensuring that they do not overlap.  

The AI model operates in **two key stages**:  

1. **Feature Extraction (Embedding Stage)**  
   - The model analyzes an image of a **single cell** and embeds it into a **high-dimensional space**.  
   - You can think of this as **describing a cell in words**‚Äîsimilar-looking cells receive similar descriptions.  
   - Instead of words, however, the model uses **numerical representations** to categorize cells efficiently.  

2. **Classification Stage**  
   - The **embedded cell representation** is fed into a **classifier** that determines whether the cell is **tumorous or healthy**.  
   - This process is repeated for every cell in the image, allowing the system to **automatically detect** all tumor and healthy cells.  

‚ö° **Challenge:** Do you think you are faster and more accurate than the AI? **Prove it!**
